        Materials offer a lot of built-in modules for your project. Features such as autocomplete, datepicker, slider, menus, grids, and toolbar are available for use with materials in Angular 4.

        To use materials, we need to import the package. Angular 2 also has all the above features but they are available as part of the @angular/core module. Angular 4 has come up with a separate module @angular/materials.. This helps the user to import the required materials.

        To start using materials, you need to install two packages - materials and cdk. Material components depend on the animation module for advanced features, hence you need the animation package for the same, i.e., @angular/animations. The package has already been updated in the previous chapter.
